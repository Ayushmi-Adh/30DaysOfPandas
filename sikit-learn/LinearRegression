# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. In this repository, we provide an overview of linear regression, its applications, and a step-by-step guide to implementing linear regression in Python.


## Introduction

Linear regression is a supervised learning technique used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input features. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

### Key Features:
- Simple to understand and interpret.
- Used for both simple and complex datasets.
- Suitable for cases where there is a clear linear relationship between variables.

## Mathematics Behind Linear Regression

Linear regression is based on the following equation:


- `y` is the dependent variable (target).
- `x` is the independent variable (feature).
- `m` is the slope of the line.
- `b` is the y-intercept.

The goal of linear regression is to find the values of `m` and `b` that minimize the error in predicting `y` for a given set of `x`.

## Types of Linear Regression

1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Involves a single independent variable.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves multiple independent variables.

## Applications

Linear regression has a wide range of applications, including:
- Predicting house prices based on square footage and other features.
- Estimating product sales based on advertising spend.
- Analyzing the impact of independent variables on an outcome.

## Implementation in Python

You can implement linear regression in Python using popular libraries like NumPy and Scikit-Learn. Here's a basic example:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to your data
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_new)
