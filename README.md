## Overview

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers systems to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Here are some fundamental concepts covered in this project:

### 1. Types of Machine Learning:

- **Supervised Learning:** The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where input features are paired with corresponding output labels.

- **Unsupervised Learning:** The model explores patterns in unlabeled data, aiming to find hidden structures or relationships.

- **Reinforcement Learning:** The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

### 2. Common Algorithms:

- **Linear Regression:** Used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

- **Decision Trees:** Tree-like structures that make decisions based on input features.

- **Clustering Algorithms:** Such as K-Means, which groups similar data points together in an unsupervised manner.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.

- **Precision and Recall:** Evaluate the performance of a classification model.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

### 4. Feature Engineering:

- **Scaling and Normalization:** Ensures features are on a similar scale for improved model performance.

- **One-Hot Encoding:** Converts categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### 5. Model Training and Testing:

- **Training Set:** The data used to train the machine learning model.

- **Testing Set:** Unseen data used to evaluate the model's generalization performance.
